Basic Algorithms i wrote during my Introduction to algorithms class

The following algorithms are implemented in either C or C++. There is no OOPs concept, so knowing only C will do fine.

Algorithms:

1. Prim`s Minimum spanning tree
2. Kruskal`s minimum spanning tree
3. Assembly line problem
4. Graph coloring problem
5. Implementing Graph (Adjacency matrix)
6. Single Source Shortest Path
7. All Pairs Shortest Path (Using Dynamic Programming)
8. N- Queens Problem
9. Longest Common Sub-Sequence
10. Matric Chain Multiplication
11. Fractional Knapsack (Greedy)
12. 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)
13. Sorting:
	a) Bubble Sort
	b) Insertion Sort
	c) Selection Sort
	d) Merge Sort
	e) Quick Sort
	f) Heap Sort
	g) Radix Sort
